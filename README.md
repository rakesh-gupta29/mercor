# Boilerplate code for React and Tailwind

---

Project structure:

- follows atomic UI structure:

  - atoms: barebone HTML elements and utilities. e.g. buttons, accordions, dropdowns
  - molecules: composed of atoms. e..g cards
  - organisms: combination of molecules e.g. contact form, testimonials section

- ### Flow

- protected routes are enclosed in the wrapper (here, auth protector).
- routes tree can be composed in the routes folder which is then rendered as routes.
- this make the API call and caches the result in context.
  - <em>For simpler state, auth works fine. otherwise, would have used state manegers, most probably recoil. It works well with NextJS applications too.
- we can extend the feature of route protection by making the API call once the app loads.
- this model is highly extensible with flexibility of making calls for each render or periodical calls or event based calls like tab focus.
- Employed proper error handling and reflecting the same in user interface.
  App loads => auth context is setup after an API call to verify the uesr (maybe through auth tokens) => result is stored in the context => accessible to all route wrappers
